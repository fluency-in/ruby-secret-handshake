# Ruby: Secret Handshake

Write a program that will take a decimal number, and convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

> There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand
> binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to
binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 9, the function would return the array
["wink", "jump"]

Given the input "11001", the function would return the array
["jump", "wink"]


The program should consider strings specifying an invalid binary as the
value 0.

The tests use the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests with the `ruby` command:

    ruby secret_handshake_test.rb
